# SYS 611: Modeling Tools

This week's lecture discusses modeling tools as a precursor to simulation. Example Python files for this week are:
 * TicTacToe - a partial implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe board game
 * DiceFigters - a complete implementation of the Dice Figters example problem
 * DiceFightersOO - an object-oriented implementation of the same Dice Fighters example problem
 
 The examples are provided in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb). There are generally three ways to access:
 1. Clone the entire repository using a Git client and open in Jupyter notebook running on your machine
 2. Download individual files (make sure to download the raw file, not necessarily what appears in your web browser) and open in Jupyter notebook running on your machine
 3. Copy and paste the URL to a third party Jupyter notebook (e.g., Google Colab)
