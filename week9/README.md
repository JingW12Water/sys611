 * CustomerQueuingModel - simulation for a customer-centric single-server queuing system.
 * EventQueuingModel - simulation for an event-centric single-server queuing system.
 * QueuingBalkModel - simulation for an event-centric single-server queuing system with balking.
 * InventoryModel - simulation for an event-centric inventory system.
